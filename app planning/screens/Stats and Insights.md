	•	Description: Provides additional insights to help players understand their character pool and team compositions.
	•	Features:
	•	Stat Trends: Shows averages, highest, and lowest stats across the player’s character pool.
	•	Strengths and Weaknesses: Identify areas where the player’s roster excels or lacks (e.g., low defense across available characters).
	•	Team Synergy Insights: Highlights effective combinations, such as complementary skills or boosting roles.

```kotlin
	data class Character(
					val name: String,
					val stats: Map<String, Int>
	)

	data class TeamComposition(
					val characters: List<Character>
	)

	fun calculateStatTrends(characters: List<Character>): Map<String, Map<String, Int>> {
					// Implementation to calculate averages, highest, and lowest stats
	}

	fun identifyStrengthsAndWeaknesses(characters: List<Character>): Map<String, String> {
					// Implementation to identify strengths and weaknesses
	}

	fun highlightTeamSynergy(composition: TeamComposition): List<String> {
					// Implementation to highlight effective combinations
	}

	fun main() {
					val characters = listOf(
									Character("Warrior", mapOf("attack" to 80, "defense" to 60)),
									Character("Mage", mapOf("attack" to 70, "defense" to 40))
					)
					val teamComposition = TeamComposition(characters)

					val statTrends = calculateStatTrends(characters)
					val strengthsAndWeaknesses = identifyStrengthsAndWeaknesses(characters)
					val teamSynergy = highlightTeamSynergy(teamComposition)

					println("Stat Trends: $statTrends")
